 * Enables C++-style BSP communication; sizes and offsets
 * are given in number of elements of a specific type.
 * If any of the data pointers are of type (void*), then 
 * offset and sizes must be given in bytes as in plain C.
 *
 * An example is the following. Consider each SPMD process
 * having an array of P doubles and one given value x that
 * needs to be broadcast to all other processes. Normally,
 * the below suffices (assuming the array is registered):
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * for( unsigned int k = 0; k < bsp_nprocs(); ++k ) {
 *     bsp_put( k, &x, arr, bsp_pid() * sizeof(double), sizeof(double) );
 * }
 * bsp_sync();
 * \endcode
 *
 * With C++ and mcbsp-templates extensions, this becomes
 * instead:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * for( unsigned int k = 0; k < bsp_nprocs(); ++k ) {
 *     bsp_put( k, &x, array, bsp_pid(), 1 );
 * }
 * bsp_sync();
 * \endcode
 *
 * Additionally, the last two parameters are optional; the
 * length defaults to 1 element, while the offset defaults
 * to 0, making very short statements possible whenever
 * appropriate.

 * The function differs from the regular bsp_send in two major ways:
 * (1) the actual send communication may occur between now and the
 *     end of the next synchronisation phase, and
 * (2) the tag and payload data is read and sent somewhere between
 *     now and the end of the next synchronisation phase.
 * If you change the contents of the memory area tag and payload
 * point to after calling this function, undefined communication
 * will occur.
 * The semantics of BSMP remain unchanged: the sent messages will
 * only become available at the remote processor when the next
 * computation superstep begins. The performance gain is two-fold:
 * (a) bsp_hpsend avoids buffering-on-send, and
 * (b) BSP may send messages during a computation phase, thus
 *     overlapping computation with communication.
 *
 * Ad (a): normally, BSMP in BSP copies tag and payload data at
 * least three times. It buffers on bsp_send (buffer-on-send),
 * it buffers at the receiving processes' incoming BSMP queue 
 * (buffer-on-receive), and finally bsp_get_tag and bsp_move 
 * copy the data in the target user-supplied memory areas. To 
 * also eliminate the latter data movement, please consider
 * using bsp_hpmove.
 *
 * Ad (b): it is not guaranteed this overlap results in faster 
 * execution time. You should think about if using these high-
 * performance primitives makes sense on a per-application 
 * basis, and factor in the extra costs  of structuring your 
 * algorithm to enable correct use of these primitives.
