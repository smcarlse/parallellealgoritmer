Known issues (since version 2.0.3):

- when compiling on OS X using GCC, you may
  need to replace `native' with `corei7' for
  each of the -march / -mtune flags.

- the automatically generated benchmark plots
  in benchmarks/plot_results (by executing
  cd benchmarks && make) cannot be properly
  plotted by Octave 4.2.2 due to a bug in its
  `legend' built-in script. (MATLAB works.)
  
- when compiling with Clang prior to version
  4.0, (harmless) warnings will be displayed.
